                <p>Powerhouse of the Cell is dedicated to transforming science education through the power of
                    animation. We believe that science should be accessible and exciting for all learners, regardless
                    of their background. Our mission is to provide free online educational resources that
                    revolutionize the way science is taught and understood.

                <h1>Our Vision</h1>
                <p>At Powerhouse of the Cell, we envision a world where scientific knowledge is not confined to textbooks and lectures
                    but comes alive through captivating visuals. We strive to empower students, educators,
                    and scientists by bridging the gap between theory and practice and inspiring
                    curiosity for the natural world.

                <ol>
                    <li style=" margin-bottom: 12px;"><b>Educational Animations:</b> Science shouldn't be learned just through textbooks and
                        still images! We create high-quality animations that simplify complex scientific
                        concepts and bring science to life.
                    </li>
                    <li style=" margin-bottom: 12px;"><b>Learning through Stories:</b> We use
                        <a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/MATSTT" target="_blank">proven</a>
                        <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1098-237X(199707)81:4%3C405::AID-SCE3%3E3.0.CO;2-G" target="_blank">pedagogical</a>
                        <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11191-009-9191-9" target="_blank">techniques</a> that incorporate the rich history of scientific
                        discoveries. By being exposed to the scientific method, learners develop critical analysis, and this approach fosters a mindset that science is not something to be memorized,
                        but something to be discovered.
                    </li>
                    <li style=" margin-bottom: 12px;"><b>Research Communication**:</b> We create animations for scientists!
                        Whether you are working on a publication, conference presentation, or social media post, we're happy to help you more effectively
                        share and communicate your research. We will translate your complex scientific discoveries into engaging visual
                        stories.
                    </li>
                    <li style=" margin-bottom: 12px;"><b>Free Access:</b> We are committed to ensuring that educational resources are available to everyone, regardless of
                        location or financial constraints. All our animations are freely accessible and are subtitled in multiple languages.
                    </li>
