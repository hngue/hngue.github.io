                <p>Powerhouse of the Cell is dedicated to transforming science education through the power of
                    animation. We believe that science should be accessible and exciting for all learners, regardless
                    of their background. Our mission is to provide free online educational resources that
                    revolutionize the way science is taught and understood.

                <h1>Our Vision</h1>
                <p>At Powerhouse of the Cell, we envision a world where scientific knowledge is not confined to textbooks and lectures
                    but comes alive through captivating visuals. We strive to empower students, educators,
                    and scientists by bridging the gap between theory and practice and inspiring
                    curiosity for the natural world.

                <ol>
                    <li style=" margin-bottom: 12px;"><b>Educational Animations:</b> Science shouldn't be learned just through textbooks and
                        still images! We create high-quality animations that simplify complex scientific
                        concepts and bring science to life.
                    </li>
                    <li style=" margin-bottom: 12px;"><b>Learning through Stories:</b> We use

                        discoveries. By being exposed to the scientific method, learners develop critical analysis, and this approach fosters a mindset that science is not something to be memorized,
                        but something to be discovered.
                    </li>
                    <li style=" margin-bottom: 12px;"><b>Research Communication**:</b> We create animations for scientists!
                        Whether you are working on a publication, conference presentation, or social media post, we're happy to help you more effectively
                        share and communicate your research. We will translate your complex scientific discoveries into engaging visual
                        stories.

                    <li style=" margin-bottom: 12px;"><b>Free Access:</b> We are committed to ensuring that educational resources are available to everyone, regardless of
                        location or financial constraints. All our animations are freely accessible and are subtitled in multiple languages.

                    <h1>About the Author</h1>
                    <p>Harrison Ngue is a medical educator and aspiring physician-scientist currently attending Harvard Medical School and MIT. He has published on healthcare and oncology in many reputable journals such as American Scientist, Science Advances, Cancer Research, and the Journal of Respiratory Diseases. His research works have been recognized by both national and international organizations such as the American Association for Cancer Research, Amgen Scholars Foundation, and Sigma Xi Scientific Research Honor Society.
                    </p>
                    <p>Harrison completed his undergraduate education at Harvard College in biomedical engineering and history of science. As a college student, Harrison went from having never conducted wet lab research to identifying three novel cellular pathways contributing to chemotherapy resistance in quiescent G0 leukemia cells in Professor Shobha Vasudevan’s lab. From this undergraduate thesis work, Harrison was awarded the prestigious Herchel Smith Fellowship, Thomas T. Hoopes Prize, and Bowdoin Prize (top 2 thesis at Harvard).
                    </p>
                    <p>After completing his undergraduate degree, Harrison pursued additional training in understanding metabolic contributions to oncogenesis with Professor Matthew G. Vander Heiden at MIT, and understanding chemical biology techniques to develop single-molecule breast cancer diagnostics with Professor David R. Walt at the Wyss Institute. Throughout his training, Harrison’s goal has been to study cellular-level pathophysiology in neoplastic disorders and translate his research findings to revolutionize the clinical landscape of oncology.
                    </p>
                    <p>Harrison is also passionate about teaching and mentorship. Growing up in a low-income Burmese American household in East Los Angeles, he recognizes the disparities in educational resources and strives to level the playing field for underprivileged students, especially in science. In 2020, he created Powerhouse of the Cell, an animated science YouTube channel that has reached over 1.5 million individuals across all digital platforms and has led him to be recognized at several national conferences and scientific film festivals for his work on educational equity. His efforts on these fronts have also sparked collaborations with the online education platform edX and the USA Science and Engineering Festival.
                    </p>
                    <p>Additionally, Harrison has taught quantitative physiology, organic chemistry, and pharmacology at Harvard College and was selected as part of the inaugural class of the Harvard Chemistry Teaching Awards in 2023. Harrison’s philosophy of creating lifelong learners through fostering a safe space in his classroom has translated to a dynamic learning environment where students feel empowered to explore, question, and grow beyond the confines of traditional academia.
